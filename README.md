# Business-Metrics-Analysis-with-Python
This project provides a Python-based analysis of crucial business metrics using the Pandas library. It calculates and analyzes profit, profit margin, customer acquisition rate, and churn rate. The analysis includes monthly aggregations and trend identification, culminating in a business analysis dashboard visualized with Matplotlib.

Key insights are derived from revenue, expenses, customer acquisition, and churn data. The project pinpoints periods of significant churn and highlights customer growth trends, offering valuable perspectives on business performance over time. This repository contains the Python scripts and potentially the sample data (business_data.xlsx) used for this analysis. It serves as a practical example of how to leverage Python for business intelligence and data-driven decision-making.
